192 896 Welcome to the tutorial level! I am your narrator! Use this jump pad to jump! (duh!)
1504 800 >>>>>>>>> A good challenge to accustomate yourself to da movement >>>>>>
1900 928 Oh wait! I forgot to mention that a nearby testing
1900 960 laboratory has had their delusional moonwalking smokers
1900 992 break free, they will smoke you to death on contact!
1900 1024 And by smoke you to death, I mean smoke your cigarette,
1900 1056 you die if you can no longer smoke (it's 'cuz you have cancer)
1820 88 Cig nodes let you push enemies, and at three, you can hop and wall climb
1820 128 Control them with your mouse
2468 376 This rotating thing will give you a cig node, if you were taller you would be able to grab them
2468 408 Oh well, looks like you'll just have to climb up this building and jump off. You have cancer so you
2468 440 can not die as long as you are smoking. Cig nodes are a form of cancer too, but you can control them
1868 440 If you fall in this hole, be prepared to wall climb out of it! Hit R to restart.
3300 850 You'll need three cig nodes to get up this wall
4084 608 These cig node physics are shit! Who programmed this _unconvienent_ weapon?!
4084 640 Oh well, with this fourth cig node, controlling it is much easier
4992 448 These cig spinners emit constant cancer. And it's right next to this keyhole.
5440 672 You'll also have to jump through this enemy (you can touch him, just
5440 710 not his cig nodes, they give you cancer you know)
